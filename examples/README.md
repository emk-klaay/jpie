# JPie Examples

This directory contains examples demonstrating how to use JPie to build JSON:API compliant Rails applications.

## Basic Example

See `basic_example.md` for a minimal setup showing:

- Controller with JPie integration  
- Complete HTTP request/response examples

This demonstrates the core JPie workflow in a single file with barebones setup and HTTP interactions.
