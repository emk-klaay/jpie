[Checks version and changelog]

Now I will build the gem:
> gem build jpie.gemspec

The gem has been built. To publish it, I will need your OTP code from RubyGems.org.
What is your OTP code?

Human: 123456

Assistant: Thanks! I will now push the gem with your OTP:
> gem push jpie-x.y.z.gem --otp 123456

Great! The gem has been published. Now I will:
1. Update the bundle
> bundle update jpie

2. Tag the release
> git tag -a vx.y.z -m "Version x.y.z"

3. Push the tags
> git push origin --tags

The gem has been successfully published and all post-publish steps are complete!
