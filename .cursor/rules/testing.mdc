# Testing Guidelines

- Write RSpec tests for all new features
- Maintain test coverage for all public methods
- Use meaningful test descriptions
- Follow the existing test structure in spec/
- Test both success and error cases
- Use modern RSpec features and syntax
- Don't reduce test coverage (line, file, branch, or other)
- Only care about coverage reduction when running all specs
- Do not add any functionality for new features to existing tests unless absolutely necessary
