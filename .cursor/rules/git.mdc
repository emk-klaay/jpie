# Git Commit Guidelines

- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Run and pass tests before committing
- Update documentation in the same commit as code changes
- Ignore spec/examples.txt and other files listed in .gitignore
- Include Ruby/Rails version requirements in relevant commits
- Update tests in the same commit as code changes
